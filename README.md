# motherboardmanagement

HOW TO USE:

Run the script by:
 
    python MotherboardManagement.py [CSV FILE NAME]
  
That's it, follow the on screen instructions. You don't have to put a file name. The default csv file generated is named M.csv. It will be generated automatically if it doesn't exist. 

If you ever wish to edit the csv by yourself, here is the format:

    MOTHERBOARD_NAME,BROUGHT_PRICE,SOLD_PRICE,PROFIT
    
Do not include currency symbols in the list. Put numbers only
